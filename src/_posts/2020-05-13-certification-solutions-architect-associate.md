## The AWS Certification Process

Before discussing the Solutions Architect Associate exam, lets review the certification process as of the date of this post. As of now there are 12 total certifications split across 4 levels of difficulty.

- Foundational - Targeted at individuals who require a general overview of AWS and cloud best practices.
- Associate - Targeted at individuals with a modest amount of AWS experience.
- Professional - Targeted at individuals with an in-depth knowledge of AWS services in a professional capacity.
- Specialty - Targeted at individuals in a role that requires specialist knowledge of particular AWS services.

So why would I decide to go through the certification process? Well I had been using AWS for several years and now wanted to validate the knowledge and skills I had acquired, additionally I wanted to fill in the cracks around services that I hadn't had as much exposure to.

I am a firm believer in the value of education and learning, to pass these certifications I didn't want to just know the answers, I also wanted to have a firm understanding of the services and best practices.

## Passing My First Certification

In August 2018 I finally decided it was time to start my certification process, and the Solutions Architect - Associate would be the first stop on the journey. I booked my exam for the following month so that I had a date to aim for and got set for studying.

The [Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam is targeted at individuals who architect network/application solutions in their role, using the best practices for resilience, performance, security and cost-effectiveness.

For this exam I used the [course](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) produced by Ryan Kroonenburg at A Cloud Guru, for anyone sitting this exam I highly recommend the courses produced by the talented team at A Cloud Guru.

I spent weekends watching a few of the videos, many of the services I'd already experienced, however some services such as [Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) and [Storage Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/) I was able to gain more insight into how they're used.

Additionally through reading the [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) I was able to understand the thought processes that went into designing the AWS architecture. The framework is designed to help architects make the best decisions for their architectures and is a must for anyone who wants to perform a cloud architecture based role using AWS.

When it came to exam I arrived at the exam centre feeling prepared but cautious. The exam itself is multiple choice, this does not however mean that it is a simple walkthrough. The exams questions are scenarios that test that you understand the AWS architecture enough to recommend the best approach to a solution based upon a modifier. The modifier could be security, performance or cost, this will decide the correct option to choose.

After 43 minutes I completed my last question, I submitted the exam and was pleased to see the conglaturatory message that I had passed my first AWS certification. Having achieved this I was elated, but knew that a long journey remained to achieve the remaining certifications. In my next article I will be discussing the next certification along the way, AWS Certified Devloper - Associate.
